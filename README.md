PersonPicker
============

Small app for windows phone 8.1 which select a random person from a list and then display it's name/image.
The application uses a sqlite database to store the people's data and the picks done.
The main page uses a Pivot navigation ([msdn pivot control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/ff941098(v=vs.105).aspx)).

The app was developed just for fun and has been an excuse to start developing for windows phone! :wink:
